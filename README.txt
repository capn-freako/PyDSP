===========

PyDSP is a digital filter design tool with a graphical user interface (GUI).
It uses the Traits/TraitsUI package of the `Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) <http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>`_.
On a system with the EPD installed, PyDSP can be launched from the command prompt,
from within the directory containing the *pydsp.py* file, like this:

* Unix, Max OS X::

    $ ./pydsp.py

* Windows::

    > python pydsp.py
